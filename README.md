# FYP_Project
This project aims to build a web based application that allows users to connect and sync their fitness data from Strava. It then converts GPS data using data from Strava into a sharable Hyperlapse video built using Googleâ€™s Street View images as its source material without having the user to take any video recordings of the trail itself.
